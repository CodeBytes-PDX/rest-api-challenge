# rest-api-challenge

### Let's Build an API!

Meetup was held on May 10, 2017

This repo contains tutorial files for a simple REST API implemented in NodeJS, Python and Ruby.

### Endpoints

Here are the endpoints you should implement:

* GET `/` -- should return `"hello world"`
* GET `/books` -- should return a list of all books
* GET `/books/5` -- Get a specific book. Should return the JSON book 5 (or whichever)
* GET `/books/5/status` -- Get a specific book's status. Should return just the status for book 5 (or whichever).
* POST `/books/add` -- Add a book to the library
* POST `/users/5/books/5/checkout` -- checkout a book for a user
* POST `/books/5/return` -- return a book to the library
* GET `/users` -- get all users as a JSON list
* GET `/users/5/books` -- get all books checked out by the given user
